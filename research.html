	<p>Decades of molecular biology investigations and recent quantum leaps in genomic technologies have given us a blueprint of the cell, including a map of its signaling cables and main response actuators. We now face the monumental challenge of understanding how signals flow in these cables and deciphering cellular information transmission protocols. We also need to generate quantitative and predictive models of the pathways involved in different cellular responses, and to systematically trace their interconnections.</p>
    <p>Our lab works at the interface of biology, engineering, and mathematics to address these challenges. A hallmark of our approach is the use of different cellular systems as specific test-beds to approach general questions about cellular logic, including signal encoding/decoding and the functions and implementations of feedback control. Our projects often involve rounds of iterations between computational and experimental investigations, powered by development of novel computational and experimental technologies.</p>

	    
    
	<p>Our lab is interested in interdisciplinary research projects at the interface of biology, mathematics, dynamical systems, and control theory.</p>
	<p>Our research group consists of an exciting mixture of mathematicians, engineers, and biologists who are developing knowledge in three main, but intersecting, directions. Specifically, we are pursuing the development of</p>

	<p>1. foundational mathematical toolkits for the computational investigation of various classes of biological networks,</p>
	<p>2. technologies that improve the resolution and quality of data necessary for these computational studies, and</p>
	<p>3. predictive mathematical models for important cellular behaviors.</p>
